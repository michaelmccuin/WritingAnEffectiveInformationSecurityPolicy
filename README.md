<h2>Project Walk-Through:</h2>

Before I began writing an information security policy, I needed to determine the purpose and scope to clearly convey what the expected behaviors shall be for the entire organization. This way, individuals that violate policy can be held accountable, ensuring the policy is both respected and enforceable. After I determined the scope of who this policy applies to, I was able to develop it in a relevant way that is applicable to the separate departments within the organization. Determining the purpose and scope of the information security policy enhances the efficacy of it.

The purpose of this information security policy can be broken down into nine objectives: <br/>

  1. Title
  2. Purpose
  3. Scope
  4. Policy
  5. Related Procedures
  6. Non-Compliance
  7. Management Commitment / Authority
  8. Review Schedule
  9. Definitions
